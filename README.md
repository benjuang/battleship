battleship
==========
2 hour exercise to make the battleship game that runs in the browser (so purely HTML, JS, CSS.  Well, not pure - I'm using jQuery to make my life easier, but otherwise, nothing fancy at all).  I'm not sure why anyone would want to clone this or even use this, but hey, if you do, I'd love to know why.  Drop me a line, please.
